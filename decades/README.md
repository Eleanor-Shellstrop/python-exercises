## About

I am following along an exercise in Pluralsight's course Practical Python for Beginners: Age Calculator.

Nothing other than an updated version of Python is needed to run this program. 

Pluralsight's instructions for exercise found here: https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/practical-python-beginners/table-of-contents

## Objective
Have a user input their age and return the number of decades the user has lived.
