## About

I am following along an exercise in Pluralsight's course *Core Python: Classes and Object-Orientation*.

Nothing other than an updated version of Python is needed to run these programs.

## Course Description

Classes are crucial tool in Python for organizing data and behavior. In this course, Core Python: Classes and object-orientation, you’ll learn how to apply fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. First, you’ll learn how to distinguish between classes and instances, and define attributes on both. Next, you’ll explore properties using them to encapsulate state. Finally, you’ll discover how to combine classes using inheritance and multiple inheritance, and have these classes collaborate in ways which are distinctive to the Python language. When you’re finished with this course, the will have the skills and knowledge of the core Python language needed to develop larger and robust software systems.
