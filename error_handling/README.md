## About

I am following along an exercise in Pluralsight's course *Core Python: Robust Resource and Error Handling*.

Nothing other than an updated version of Python is needed to run these programs. 

Pluralsight's instructions for exercise found here: https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/core-python-robust-resource-error-handling/description

## Course Description

The dominant error handling strategy in Python is the use of exceptions, and exceptions are ubiquitous in the Python language, standard library, and package ecosystem. In this course, Core Python: Robust Resource and Error Handling, you’ll understand how to work with exceptions in Python. First, you’ll be introduced to context managers, Python’s facility for safely and automatically managing resources. Next, you'll see how larger systems often benefit greatly from more sophisticated exception handling strategies. Finally, you'll discover how to model database transactions. When you're finished with this course, you’ll know how to chain associated exception together, define your own exceptions, and define and deploy context managers.
