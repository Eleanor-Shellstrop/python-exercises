## About

I am following along an exercise in Pluralsight's course Practical Python for Beginners: Rock, Paper, Scissors.

Nothing other than an updated version of Python is needed to run this program. 

Codecademy instructions for project found here: https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/practical-python-beginners/table-of-contents

## Objective
Create a rock, paper, scissors game where the user plays the computer.
